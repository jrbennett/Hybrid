            <title>4th Man Out - Trailer</title>

            <link>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/4thmanout/</link>

            <description>Adam is your average working-class guy living in small-town America. He's an auto mechanic who spends his free time with his tight-knit band of bros, Chris, Nick and Ortu, with whom he does everythingâ€”poker, video games, shooting hoops, getting drunk and meeting women. But there is something about Adam that even his friends don't know. He is not that interested in women. When he comes out, sort of by accident but not really, his best friend Chris promises him that nothing will change but, of course, some things do. After the initial shock, the boys quickly come around to the fact that Adam is still the same dude, but when his double date with Chris ends disastrously, a drunken misunderstanding threatens to derail the group's entire dynamic. Fourth Man Out is a feel-good buddy comedy with plenty of heart that focuses on the growing pains and ultimate strengths of of friendship.</description>

            <title>Where to Invade Next - Trailer</title>

            <link>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/wheretoinvadenext/</link>

            <description>Where to Invade Next is an expansive, rib-tickling, and subversive comedy in which Moore, playing the role of â€œinvader,â€ visits a host of nations to learn how the U.S. could improve its own prospects. The creator of Fahrenheit 9/11 and Bowling for Columbine is back with this hilarious and eye-opening call to arms. Turns out the solutions to Americaâ€™s most entrenched problems already exist in the worldâ€”theyâ€™re just waiting to be co-opted.</description>

            <description>Blinded by the light of a falling meteor, David has a devastating car accident, leading to a profound discovery: an extra-terrestrial organism that may contain the secret of life itself. When David goes missing for two days, Annabelle searches for her father only to discover him wandering the forest, without so much as a scratch. Davidâ€™s mysterious reappearance draws the attention of federal authorities and gives Annabelle reason to doubt his sanity. But David has a new sense of purpose, fueled by nightmarish visions. Driven by what he believes is an otherworldly purpose, David must convince Annabelle to believe him and complete his task before government agents can stop him, and before the world destroys itself.</description>

            <title>The Land of the Enlightened - Trailer</title>

            <link>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/thelandoftheenlightened/</link>

            <description>Shot in stunning 16mm over the course of 7 years in Afghanistan, The Land of the Enlightened is the astonishing first feature of Pieter-Jan De Pue, which combines a vÃ©ritÃ© portrait of a nation and its young people with the magic-reality of their dreams.

                In the vast mountain region of the northern Wakhan Corridor ("The Roof of the World"), a gang of nomadic children raid caravans and trade scavenged Soviet landmines, raw lapis lazuli and black opium for food and fuel. Possessing a talent for improvisation and an inexhaustible eagerness to learn, they navigate a harsh reality as U.S. forces begin to pull out of the country, all the while dreaming of themselves asâ€‹ â€‹warriors and kings in a future Afghanistan. Fusing their vivid imaginings with documented reality, De Pue has created an exhilarating story that pushes the boundaries of nonfiction filmmaking. World premiere, Sundance 2016.</description>
